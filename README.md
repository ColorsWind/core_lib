## Core_lib

A collection of libraries and methods to speed up the process of creating an spigot plugin

## Repository

The artifacts are currently hosted on repsy. Unfortunately the repository is private for now, but it may change on the future.

## Contributos

A lot of the methods are done by myself, but others features are taken from helper(Lucko) and RedLib(Redempt)
